# Knowledge Engineering Projects 🧠💡

This section contains the following Knowledge Engineering projects:

*   **[A\* Algorithm](./Algoritmo%20A%20Estrella/)** 🗺️: A simplified implementation of the A\* search algorithm. It simulates a vehicle navigating a grid from a start point to a target point, potentially avoiding obstacles.

*   **[ID3 Tree](./Árbol%20ID3/)** 🌳: An implementation focusing on the first step of the ID3 algorithm, used in AI for finding rules or hypotheses from a dataset. It selects the best initial attribute to split the data based on examples (tuples of attribute values) with a binary target attribute. *(Note: This version is not fully recursive)*.

*   **[K-Means Clustering](./Aprendizaje%20con%20agrupamiento%20K-Medias/)** 📊: Implements the K-Means clustering method. Its goal is to partition *n* observations into *k* clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). Widely used in data mining.

*   **[Bayesian Parametric Estimation/Classification](./Aprendizaje%20con%20estimación%20paramétrica%20de%20Bayes/)** 📈: Implements classification based on parametric estimation, likely assuming Gaussian distributions for classes. It estimates parameters (mean, covariance) from labeled data and uses them to classify new instances. The calculation approach differs from K-Means.
