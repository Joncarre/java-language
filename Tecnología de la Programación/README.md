# Programming Technology Projects 💻🕹️

## What projects are here?

In this programming section, you'll currently find the following projects:

*   **[Virtual Machine](./Máquina%20Virtual/)** ⚙️: Implements a simple Virtual Machine. Functionality is gradually added across versions, eventually enabling it to load, compile, and execute programs written in a basic imperative language from a file.

*   **[Games using MVC](./Juegos%20usando%20MVC/)** 🎮: Features a series of games implemented using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The initial versions are console-based, with later versions incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.
